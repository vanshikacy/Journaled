# Journaled

**Your digital journal, reimagined.**  
Journaled is a full-stack journaling app made with React and Firebase, designed to help you reflect, record, and reconnect with your inner world.
This is the base version, but the vision goes beyond text—I’m building toward a journal that can hold every layer of your day: emotions, media, music, and more.
